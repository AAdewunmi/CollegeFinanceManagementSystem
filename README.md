# College Finance Management System
This project is a simple financial system for a college.

It is a Java-based console application that allows a user to manage the finances
of students, teachers and the college. A user can also add, delete and find 
students, teachers, as well as pay tuition fees for students and increase the salary 
of teachers. 

The system also allows the user to view the total amount of money earned
by the college, the total amount of money spent by the college and the balance available
to the college.

Here is a screenshot of the application:
